Repos contains three algorithms.
1. Player Influence - The Player Influence algorithm employs distance metrics to assess a player’s proximity to the ball over specified time intervals. By quantifying this spatial relationship between a player and the ball, I hope to offer insights into an individual players contributions and influence during the game.

2. Team Closeness - The Team Closeness algorithm focuses on team dynamics. This experiment evaluates the spatial organisation of outfield players in the lead-up to turnovers of possession. By mapping 1-to-1 relationships among players, I hope to provide an analysis of the team’s coherence in both losing and winning control over the ball.

3. Blocking Passes - The Blocking Passes algorithm builds upon the foundations laid by the Team Closeness algorithm, the Blocking Passes experiment examines the availability of passing options for the team in possession prior to the loss of possession, with the hope to offer insights into how defensive pressure and player positioning impact passing lanes and decision-making.

Each of these experiments contribute to a deeper understanding of soccer’s intricate dynamics, providing both theoretical insights and practical applications for both team performance and strategies. Accompanying each experiment is a set of results which detail the empirical findings and their implications for improving aspects such as a player’s influence, the team cohesion and decision-making during possession dynamics.
